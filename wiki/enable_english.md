# [리눅스] Bash enable 사용법

## Overview
The `enable` command in Bash is used to enable or disable shell built-in commands. It allows users to control which built-in commands are available for use in the current shell session. By default, certain built-in commands may be disabled, and the `enable` command provides a way to toggle their availability.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `enable` command is as follows:

```bash
enable [-n] [name ...]
```

### Options:
- `-n`: This option disables the specified built-in commands.
- `name`: The name of the built-in command(s) to enable or disable. If no names are provided, `enable` will display the current status of all built-in commands.

## Examples

### Example 1: Enabling a Built-in Command
To enable a built-in command, you can simply use the command followed by the name of the built-in. For example, to enable the `echo` command:

```bash
enable echo
```

### Example 2: Disabling a Built-in Command
If you want to disable a built-in command, you can use the `-n` option. For instance, to disable the `echo` command:

```bash
enable -n echo
```

### Example 3: Checking Status of Built-in Commands
To check the status of all built-in commands, you can run the `enable` command without any arguments:

```bash
enable
```

This will list all built-in commands along with their current enabled or disabled status.

## Tips
- Use the `enable` command with caution, as disabling essential built-in commands may affect your shell's functionality.
- To quickly check which built-in commands are available, use `enable` without arguments to get an overview.
- Remember that changes made with the `enable` command are session-specific and will not persist after closing the terminal or starting a new session.
