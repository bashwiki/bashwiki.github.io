# [리눅스] Bash typeset 사용법

## Overview
The `typeset` command in Bash is used to declare variables and their attributes. It allows you to define the scope and characteristics of variables, such as making them read-only, integer-only, or local to a function. This command is particularly useful in scripts where variable management is crucial for maintaining clean and predictable code.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `typeset` command is as follows:

```bash
typeset [options] variable_name=value
```

### Common Options
- `-i`: Treat the variable as an integer. Arithmetic operations will be performed on it.
- `-r`: Make the variable read-only, preventing any further modification.
- `-l`: Convert the variable's value to lowercase.
- `-u`: Convert the variable's value to uppercase.
- `-a`: Declare an indexed array.
- `-A`: Declare an associative array.
- `-x`: Export the variable to the environment of subsequently executed commands.

## Examples

### Example 1: Declaring an Integer Variable
```bash
typeset -i num=5
num=num+10
echo $num  # Output: 15
```
In this example, the `-i` option is used to declare `num` as an integer. The arithmetic operation automatically updates its value.

### Example 2: Creating a Read-Only Variable
```bash
typeset -r constant=100
echo $constant  # Output: 100
constant=200    # This will result in an error
```
Here, the `-r` option makes `constant` read-only. Any attempt to change its value will result in an error.

## Tips
- Use `typeset` to enforce variable types and attributes, which can help prevent bugs in larger scripts.
- Remember that `typeset` is primarily a Bash built-in command, and its behavior may vary in other shells.
- When using `typeset` within functions, consider the scope of your variables to avoid unintended side effects in your scripts.
- For better readability, group related variable declarations together using `typeset` at the beginning of your script or function.
