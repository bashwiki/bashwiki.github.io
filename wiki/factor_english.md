# [리눅스] Bash factor 사용법

## Overview
The `factor` command in Bash is a utility that computes the prime factors of a given integer. Its primary purpose is to break down numbers into their constituent prime factors, which can be useful in various mathematical applications, cryptography, and number theory. This command can handle multiple numbers at once and provides a straightforward output of the factors.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `factor` command is as follows:

```
factor [OPTION]... [NUMBER]...
```

### Common Options
- `-h`, `--help`: Display help information about the command and its options.
- `-V`, `--version`: Show the version of the `factor` command.

You can provide one or more integers as arguments, and the command will return the prime factors for each number.

## Examples

### Example 1: Factor a Single Number
To factor the number 28, you can use the following command:

```bash
factor 28
```

**Output:**
```
28: 2 2 7
```
This output indicates that the prime factors of 28 are 2, 2, and 7.

### Example 2: Factor Multiple Numbers
You can also factor multiple numbers in a single command. For example:

```bash
factor 15 28 100
```

**Output:**
```
15: 3 5
28: 2 2 7
100: 2 2 5 5
```
This output shows the prime factors for each of the numbers provided.

## Tips
- When using `factor`, ensure that the input numbers are non-negative integers, as negative numbers and non-integer values will not yield valid results.
- If you are working with large numbers, consider the performance of the command, as factoring can become computationally intensive.
- Use the `--help` option to quickly remind yourself of the command's syntax and options if you are unsure about its usage.

By utilizing the `factor` command effectively, you can simplify the process of prime factorization in your programming and mathematical tasks.
