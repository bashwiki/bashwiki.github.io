# [리눅스] Bash docker 사용법

## Overview
The `docker` command is a powerful tool used for managing containers in a Docker environment. Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications within lightweight, portable containers. The primary purpose of the `docker` command is to interact with the Docker daemon, allowing users to create, run, stop, and manage containers and images.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `docker` command is as follows:

```
docker [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARG...]
```

### Common Options
- `-h`, `--help`: Display help information about the command.
- `--version`: Show the version of Docker installed.
- `-D`, `--debug`: Enable debug mode for more verbose output.

### Common Commands
- `docker run`: Create and start a container.
- `docker ps`: List running containers.
- `docker images`: List available images on the local machine.
- `docker stop`: Stop a running container.
- `docker rm`: Remove a stopped container.

## Examples

### Example 1: Running a Simple Container
To run a simple container using the official Ubuntu image, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
```
This command does the following:
- `run`: Creates and starts a new container.
- `-it`: Allocates a pseudo-TTY and keeps STDIN open, allowing for interactive use.
- `ubuntu`: Specifies the image to use.
- `/bin/bash`: The command to run inside the container.

### Example 2: Listing Running Containers
To list all currently running containers, you can use:

```bash
docker ps
```
This command will display a table of running containers, including their IDs, names, and status.

## Tips
- Always ensure that your Docker daemon is running before executing Docker commands.
- Use `docker-compose` for managing multi-container applications, which simplifies the process of defining and running complex applications.
- Regularly clean up unused images and containers using `docker system prune` to free up disk space.
- Familiarize yourself with Docker's networking features to manage communication between containers effectively.
- Utilize Docker volumes to persist data generated by containers, ensuring that data is not lost when containers are stopped or removed.
