# [리눅스] Bash journalctl 사용법

## Overview
`journalctl` is a command-line utility in Linux that allows users to query and display messages from the journal, which is a component of the systemd system and service manager. The primary purpose of `journalctl` is to provide a unified interface for accessing logs generated by the system and applications, making it easier for engineers and developers to troubleshoot issues and monitor system performance.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `journalctl` command is as follows:

```bash
journalctl [OPTIONS...]
```

### Common Options:
- `-b`, `--boot`: Show messages from the current boot. You can specify a boot ID or number to view logs from previous boots.
- `-f`, `--follow`: Continuously print new log messages as they are added, similar to `tail -f`.
- `-n`, `--lines`: Show the last `n` lines of logs. For example, `-n 100` will display the last 100 log entries.
- `--since` and `--until`: Filter logs by time. For example, `--since "2023-01-01"` will show logs from January 1, 2023, onward.
- `-u`, `--unit`: Show logs for a specific systemd unit. For example, `-u ssh.service` will display logs related to the SSH service.
- `-p`, `--priority`: Filter logs by priority level (e.g., `emerg`, `alert`, `crit`, `err`, `warning`, `notice`, `info`, `debug`).

## Examples
### Example 1: Displaying Logs from the Current Boot
To view all logs generated during the current boot, you can use:

```bash
journalctl -b
```

### Example 2: Following Logs in Real-Time
To monitor logs in real-time, you can use the `-f` option:

```bash
journalctl -f
```

### Example 3: Viewing Logs for a Specific Service
To see logs for the `nginx` service, you can run:

```bash
journalctl -u nginx.service
```

## Tips
- Use the `--no-pager` option if you want to disable pagination and display all logs at once, which can be useful when redirecting output to a file.
- Combine options for more refined queries. For example, to view the last 50 lines of logs for the `ssh` service since a specific date, you can use:

```bash
journalctl -u ssh.service --since "2023-01-01" -n 50
```
- Familiarize yourself with the various priority levels to filter logs effectively, especially when troubleshooting issues.
- Consider using `grep` in combination with `journalctl` to search for specific keywords within the logs. For example:

```bash
journalctl | grep "error"
```

By mastering `journalctl`, engineers and developers can efficiently manage and analyze system logs, leading to quicker resolutions of issues and improved system reliability.
